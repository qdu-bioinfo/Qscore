# Introduction
Qscore is a comprehensive method to evaluate the performance of amplicons by integrating the amplification rate, multi-tier taxonomic annotation, sequence type and length. It takes taxonomic annotation and its abundance at any taxonomic level as input, and predicts the optimal configuration of the ecological habitat through a large number of simulated amplification data that we analyze in advance.

# Software Requirements
The package depends C++ (>= 4.8.2) we recommend using the Homebrew package manager:
~brew install gcc~ 

# Online service
We recommend it directly at [Qscore Online](http://qscore.single-cell.cn/)
